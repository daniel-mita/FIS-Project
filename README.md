### Our FIS project this semester

To run this project there are 2 commands which need to be run:
### `yarn start` 
in the front folder
### `npm run start-dev` 
in the back folder

The application can be viewed by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.

To run the tests and generate a report, type the following command in the back folder:

## Front-end

- ReactJS coupled with typescript, a superset of javascript.

- For styling and component management we use 'Material UI', a react library.


## Back-end

- NodeJS coupled with typescript, MongoDB to store and retrieve data.

- We use express for http requests and mongoose as a wrapper for easier MongoDB queries.

- The database is hosted remotely, using MongoDB Atlas as the provider and any user has real time access to the data.
